OUTPUT FILES GENERATED
---------------------
After running, you'll have these files:

1. mileage_report.txt
   - Full text report for your records
   - Detailed breakdown by week and trip

2. weekly_summary.csv (OPEN THIS IN EXCEL!)
   - Perfect for creating charts
   - Shows commute, business, and personal miles by week
   - Use Excel's chart wizard to visualize trends

3. detailed_trips.csv (OPEN THIS IN EXCEL!)
   - Every single trip with full details
   - Filter by category to see only business trips
   - Sort by distance, date, or business name
   - Great for finding specific trips for documentation

4. summary.csv (OPEN THIS IN EXCEL!)
   - Quick overview of totals
   - Business vs personal percentages
   - Use for tax reporting summary


WHAT TO DO WITH THE CSV FILES
------------------------------

FOR WEEKLY REPORTS:
1. Open weekly_summary.csv in Excel
2. Select the data (excluding TOTAL row)
3. Insert > Chart > Column Chart
4. You now have a visual weekly mileage report!

FOR TAX DOCUMENTATION:
1. Open detailed_trips.csv in Excel
2. Click on "Category" column header
3. Use Filter > Select "Business"
4. Now you see only business trips with business names
5. Print or save as PDF for tax records

FOR FINDING SPECIFIC TRIPS:
1. Open detailed_trips.csv in Excel
2. Use Ctrl+F to search for:
   - Specific dates
   - Specific addresses
   - Specific business names
3. Check the "Distance" and "Category" columns


BUSINESS LOOKUP FEATURE
-----------------------
The tool uses TWO methods to identify businesses:

METHOD 1 - AUTOMATIC LOOKUP (when you choose Y):
- Finds gas stations, restaurants, stores automatically
- Uses free OpenStreetMap data
- Takes ~1 second per new address
- Results are cached for speed

METHOD 2 - MANUAL MAPPING (always available):
- For customer sites and regular business locations
- Edit business_mapping.json file to add known businesses
- Example entry:
  "18524 NE 191st St, Woodinville": "Customer ABC - Main Office"

HOW TO ADD MANUAL BUSINESS NAMES:
1. Open business_mapping.json in Notepad
2. Add a line after the last entry:
   "ADDRESS": "BUSINESS NAME",
3. Save the file
4. Re-run the analysis

TIPS:
- Manual mappings are checked FIRST (fastest)
- Add your frequent customer locations once
- Automatic lookup handles gas stations, restaurants, etc.
- Run with lookup on first time, then cached for speed

RECOMMENDATION FOR BEST RESULTS:
1. Set up Google Places API (one-time, 10 mins - see GOOGLE_API_SETUP.txt)
   - Gets accurate names for offices, warehouses, all business types
   - FREE for typical use ($200/month credit)
   - Fast lookups (~300ms each)

2. Run analysis with lookup enabled (Y)
   - Automatically finds most business names
   - Results are cached for speed

3. Review detailed_trips.csv for any remaining street addresses
   - Add these to business_mapping.json with custom names

4. Future runs use cached + manual entries (instant!)

QUICK START (without Google API):
1. First run: Enable lookup (Y) - uses OpenStreetMap (slower but free)
2. Check CSV for addresses that need names
3. Add to business_mapping.json
4. Re-run (fast with cache)
