TROUBLESHOOTING CLIENT ISSUES
==============================

Issue: Antivirus blocks MileageAnalyzer.exe
Solution: This is a false positive (common with PyInstaller).
          Add exception in antivirus for MileageAnalyzer.exe
          File is safe - it's just packaged Python code

Issue: "volvo-trips-log.csv not found"
Solution: CSV file must be in same folder as RUN_ANALYSIS.bat
          Check filename exactly matches (case-sensitive)

Issue: Double-clicking RUN_ANALYSIS.bat does nothing
Solution: Right-click and choose "Run as Administrator"

Issue: Want to analyze different filename
Solution: Open Command Prompt in that folder and run:
          MileageAnalyzer.exe their-filename.csv


TECHNICAL DETAILS
=================

What's Inside MileageAnalyzer.exe:
- Python 3.13 interpreter
- geopy library (OpenStreetMap lookup)
- googlemaps library (Google Places API)

Platform: Windows 64-bit (Windows 7+)
Created with: PyInstaller

How It Works:

UPDATING THE TOOL
==================
